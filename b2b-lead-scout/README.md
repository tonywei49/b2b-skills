# b2b-lead-scout

B2B lead discovery skill for AutoClaw / OpenClaw agents. It searches for companies selling specific products in target regions, verifies whether they are relevant trade-facing businesses, enriches each lead with evidence-backed company/contact data, and outputs structured CSV/Markdown lead lists.

## What It Does

1. Accepts a product + region request, such as `find B2B distributors for industrial sensors in Germany`
2. Builds multi-angle bilingual search queries in English + the target market's local language
3. Searches direct keywords, broader categories, competitor-adjacent channels, directories, procurement sources, and new-entry signals
4. Deduplicates candidates using website + company identity rules
5. Verifies product relevance from official sources when possible
6. Enriches each lead with contact and classification data
7. Scores each lead with a deterministic confidence formula
8. Outputs `.csv` + `.md` files that are usable for outreach review

## Installation

Place the `b2b-lead-scout/` folder into your OpenClaw skills directory:

```text
~/.openclaw-autoclaw/skills/b2b-lead-scout/
```

The skill will be auto-discovered on next restart.

## Typical Prompts

- `find B2B gym equipment distributors in France`
- `search for Japanese industrial sensor suppliers`
- `build a prospect list of medical device importers in Mexico`
- `find Taiwan wholesalers selling packaging machinery`
- `find Turkish suppliers of pneumatic compression therapy using competitor, tender, and exhibitor discovery`

## Search Strategy

The skill is not limited to exact product-keyword search. It can search through multiple discovery angles:

- direct product + region + business type queries
- broader category searches
- competitor and brand adjacency
- procurement and tender sources
- industry directories, associations, and trade fairs
- new entrant or market-entry signals
- importer / integrator / service ecosystem discovery

This usually produces a better result set than direct keyword search alone, especially in niche B2B markets where many suppliers are discovered indirectly.

Search tool priority for web discovery:

1. Installed `tavily-search` skill, if available and configured
2. Browser Google
3. DuckDuckGo / generic web search fallback

Tavily is an optional accelerator, not a required dependency. If it is not installed or not configured, the skill should continue with browser-based and generic web search methods.

For lead qualification, official website product evidence is more important than registry data. Market registries strengthen company identity, status, and decision-maker confidence, but they should not replace product verification from the company website.

## Output

Each run produces two files in the workspace:

- `leads_[product_slug]_[region_slug]_[YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM].csv`
- `leads_[product_slug]_[region_slug]_[YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM].md`

The CSV is intended for spreadsheet review. The Markdown file summarizes result quality, lead mix, and follow-up search gaps.

For batch mode, the skill can also produce:

- `batch_leads_[batch_slug]_[YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM].csv`
- `batch_leads_[batch_slug]_[YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM].md`

In batch mode, both CSV and Markdown outputs are flat, row-based exports with one row per lead and task-level columns such as `batch_id`, `task_id`, `region`, and `product`. The CSV and Markdown schemas should match.

## Export Rules

Exports should be written with Python, not manual string concatenation.

- Prefer `scripts/export_leads.py`
- If Python is not installed on Windows, use `scripts/export_leads.ps1`
- CSV must use UTF-8 with BOM so Excel opens Chinese text correctly
- CSV must be written from a fixed field list so empty values stay in the right column
- CSV fields should be quoted to protect commas and embedded line breaks
- Markdown tables must also be generated from a fixed field list
- Markdown cell values should escape `|` and replace line breaks with `<br>`
- if exact Excel display matters for phone numbers or long numeric-like strings, also export `.xlsx` with text-formatted cells

If neither Python nor the Windows PowerShell fallback is available, fall back to `.json` plus `.md`.

## Runtime Detection

Before exporting files, detect the available runtime:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check_export_runtime.ps1
```

The script reports:

- `python_available`
- `python_command`
- `openpyxl_available`
- `powershell_available`
- `preferred_exporter`
- `xlsx_supported`

Recommended behavior:

- if `preferred_exporter=python`, run `scripts/export_leads.py`
- if `preferred_exporter=powershell`, run `scripts/export_leads.ps1`
- if `preferred_exporter=json_fallback`, skip spreadsheet export and write `.json` plus `.md`

Typical commands:

```powershell
python scripts/export_leads.py --input leads.json --output-dir . --mode batch --batch-slug demo
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/export_leads.ps1 -InputPath leads.json -OutputDir . -Mode batch -BatchSlug demo
```

## Sample Outputs

Illustrative output templates live in `examples/`:

- `examples/sample_batch_leads.csv`
- `examples/sample_leads_industrial-sensors_germany.csv`
- `examples/sample_leads_industrial-sensors_germany.md`
- `examples/sample_batch_leads.md`
- `scripts/check_export_runtime.ps1`
- `scripts/export_leads.py`
- `scripts/export_leads.ps1`

Use them as formatting references for:

- CSV column order
- how to separate `official_website`, `source_url`, and `evidence_url`
- how to present verification status and confidence
- how to structure the Markdown summary
- how to structure a batch CSV export
- how to structure a single-table batch Markdown export

## Output Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| company_name | Company name |
| country | Target country |
| city_or_region | City, state, or region |
| official_website | Canonical company website |
| source_url | Discovery source |
| evidence_url | URL used to verify product relevance |
| discovery_angle | direct_product / category / competitor_adjacent / procurement / directory / trade_fair / recent_entry / other |
| contact_person | Key contact name |
| contact_title | Job title |
| email | Business email |
| email_source | Website / LinkedIn / Hunter / Apollo / other |
| main_products | Relevant products or categories |
| business_type | brand_manufacturer / distributor / wholesaler / reseller / importer / trading_company / unknown |
| verification_status | verified / partial / manual_review |
| confidence_score | 1-10 based on explicit scoring rules |
| note | Gaps, caveats, or context |

For batch-mode CSV and Markdown tables, prepend these task-level columns:

- `batch_id`
- `task_id`
- `region`
- `product`
- `requested_business_type`
- `discovery_angle`

## Dependencies

- Optional Tavily search capability
- Optional enrichment tools such as Hunter.io or Apollo.io

## Design Principles

- Search in English + local language
- Use multiple discovery angles, not just direct product keywords
- Prefer official websites over directory pages
- Separate `source_url` from `official_website`
- Keep weak evidence, but mark it clearly and score it lower
- Favor a smaller verified list over a larger noisy list
